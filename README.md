# Lending Club Data EDA
> In this case study, apart from applying the techniques you have learnt in EDA, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information
- Write all your code in one well-commented Python file; briefly mention the insights and observations from the analysis 
- All data quality issues are correctly identified and reported. 
- Data quality issues are addressed in the right way (missing value imputation, outlier treatment and other kinds of data redundancies, etc.). 
- The right problem is solved which is coherent with the needs of the business. The analysis has a clear structure and the flow is easy to understand.

## Conclusions
- Large number of loan applicants has less than 10 years of experience
- Annual income of the applicants is bit right skewed as majority of them earn below 80k.
- DTI provides a perfect bell curve representing normal distribution
- Every year the number of loan application has increased
- 14.8% of the loan applicant has defaulted
- Loan defaulters who listed the purpose as debt consolidation has defaulted the most
- Applicants with less experience do tend to default more, because if the count of less experiences are stacked together, it will be clearly taller compared to 10+ years
- Grade B. C and D applicants tend to default the most
- Lower the grade, higher the interest rate
